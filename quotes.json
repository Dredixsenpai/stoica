    "author": "Marcus Aurelius",
    "source": "Meditations 2.15",
    "explanation": "Here Marcus recalls a saying attributed as being spoken to Monimus the Cynic, once a slave to a Corinthian money-changer: “All is as thinking makes it so” - sometimes rendered simply as “All is opinion.”\n\nTaken literally, this is obviously not true. Fire still burns. Pain still hurts. Loss is still loss. But the value of the statement lies in its great kernel of truth: what disturbs us is not the event itself, but the judgment we attach to it.\n\nEvery perception, emotional impulse, and decision begins with a thought, often one that we so quickly mistake it for reality. We feel insulted because we decide we’ve been wronged. We feel afraid because we judge a situation to be threatening. We feel embarrassed by projecting our fears and paranoias onto the unknowable minds of others.\n\nStoicism asks us to slow that process down.\n\nLetting ourselves fall prey to our impulses lets that part of you which is chaos snatch the reins from that part of you that is reason. If we follow reason, and judgements create our experience, then as long as we are rational, living a life in accordance with nature, we are not powerless. \n\nWe can examine our thoughts. We can replace “This is terrible” with “This is difficult, but workable.” We can replace “I’ve failed” with “I’ve learned.” We can choose growth over ego. We can be the audience to our own lives, and one we ought to give a good show.\n\nIn this way, not only does your judgement of reality change, but so too can your character. \n\n\"I think therefore I am\"\n\nYou become what you repeatedly tell you are. Not empty affirmations, chosen judgements that shape conduct over time. It's with repetition that all skills are learned, with habit all virtues become character."
